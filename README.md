## 🧠 Objective

To explore Netflix's global content offerings and uncover trends using data analysis techniques.

---
## Project Purpose

To explore and analyze the Netflix Movies and TV Shows dataset.

Understand key trends and insights about Netflix’s content library.

Use data visualization and analysis to answer interesting questions about the data.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix worldwide.

##Typical columns 
include:

Title

Type (Movie or TV Show)

Release Year

Duration (minutes for movies, number of seasons for TV shows)

Country of origin

Genre/Category

Date added to Netflix

## Data Cleaning & Preparation

Handle missing or null values (e.g., missing country or duration data).

Convert data types if necessary (e.g., duration from string to integer).

Extract useful information (e.g., extracting year from date columns).

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Explore data distributions and counts, like how many movies vs TV shows exist.

Analyze content release trends over time: how Netflix’s library changed year by year.

Look into geographical patterns: which countries produce the most Netflix content.

Examine duration or seasons data to understand typical lengths of movies and shows.

Explore genres to see which types of content dominate Netflix.

## Data Visualization

Use bar charts, pie charts, histograms, and line plots to show patterns clearly.

Visuals help to quickly communicate findings (e.g., a pie chart showing movies vs TV shows).

Heatmaps or stacked bar charts to show multi-dimensional insights (e.g., genre vs year).

## Insights & Observations

Majority of Netflix content may be movies or TV shows, depending on the dataset.

Certain years could show spikes in content additions, indicating Netflix growth.

Some countries dominate content production (like the US or India).

Average movie length or number of seasons for shows reveals Netflix’s content style.

Popular genres may include Drama, Comedy, Thriller, etc.

## Challenges Faced

Missing or inconsistent data fields (like missing country or duration).

Variations in data format requiring cleaning and standardization.

Deciding which visualizations best represent the data story.

## Project Tools & Environment
Used Python for data analysis.

Leveraged libraries like Pandas for handling data, Matplotlib and Seaborn for plotting.

Executed analysis and visualization inside Google Colab for easy sharing and execution.

## Learning Outcomes
Improved skills in data cleaning, manipulation, and analysis.

Gained experience visualizing complex datasets to extract meaningful trends.

Learned to work with real-world messy data and draw actionable insights.

Familiarity with Netflix’s content trends and global entertainment landscape.

## Future Improvements

Use machine learning to predict popular genres or future content trends.

Build interactive dashboards for user-friendly exploration.

Expand analysis to other streaming platforms for comparison.

Incorporate user ratings or reviews data for sentiment analysis.

##Conclusion

This Netflix Data Analysis project provided a deep dive into Netflix’s content library, revealing how the platform’s offerings vary by type, year, country, and genre. The project sharpened data handling and visualization skills, showing how data-driven insights can tell engaging stories about popular culture and entertainment. Such analysis can help content creators, marketers, and streaming platforms understand audience preferences and make strategic decisions. The work lays a solid foundation for more advanced predictive analytics or interactive data applications in the future.
